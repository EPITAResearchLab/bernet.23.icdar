# Vectorial line detection evaluation

This folder contains the transpilation from ``matlab`` to ``python`` of the evaluation of the vectorial line detection algorithm and the modified version that fix bugs and add some features.
The original matlab code can be found [here](https://github.com/NamgyuCho/Linelet-code-and-YorkUrban-LineSegment-DB).

Both folder contains a prof of concept of the algorithm notebook to display the output of the evaluation on simple cases.
